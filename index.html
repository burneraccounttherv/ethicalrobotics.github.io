      <div id="article_window">
        <p id="sec_1" class="article_section">
          Robotics is a rapidly growing industry that is transforming the gloabal economy.
          Advancements in the field are a double-edged sword with serious ethical implications that must be
          understood by society. While automation gives rise to productivity and efficiency, the impacts
          of the technology on job displacement, income inequality, and resposible developement are concerning.
        </p>
        <p id="sec_2" class="article_section">
          The prosperity granted by automation on the economy cannot be ignored. A 2020 study by the
          International Federation of Robotics (IFR) found a strong correlation between robotic adoption and
          economic growth. An estimated 10% of GDP growth was due to robot-driven productivity.
          <br><br>
          While robotics may cause serious job displacement, but more jobs will be created in compensation.
          A 2017 report by McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 950 million jobs can be created through
          automation, especially in areas of healthcare, education, and technology.
          <br><br>
          Some of the jobs that could be displaced by robotics may be necessary. Having robots take over jobs that
          are high risk for injury or dangerous in the long-term may be better for the job market. According to the
          Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2022 there were over 3.4 million reported nonfatal workplace injuries in the US.
        </p>
        <p id="sec_3" class="article_section">
          The biggest concern is that robotics will automate tasks originally performed by humans leading to large
          waves of unemployment. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper estimates that for
          every additional robot per 1,000 workers, theres a 0.18 to 0.34 percentage point decline in the
          employment-to-population ratio.
          <br><br>
          The usage of robotics seems to be concentrated to certain geographic regions. A 2018 report by the Century
          Foundation points to a study showing a 4.0% to 5.0% decline in wages for young, less-educated workers
          in Midwestern manufacturing hubs.
          <br><br>
          If AI is put in a role that requires complex decision-making, their thought process to a decision is
          very opaque. The complex algorithms used by AI does not give us a clear cut understanding of how the
          decision was reached. Relative to a human that can explain themselves. An investigation by the US
          Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that some large banks were using AI models for loan
          approval that exhibited racial bias.
        </p>
        <p id="sec_4" class="article_section">
          Automation is a double-edged sword, it is an avenue of tremendous potential but possess downsides
          of equal magnitude. If used correctly, AI can help us boost productivity, ensure worker safety, and
          contribute to a more sustainable future.
          <br>
          On the other hand, AI could drive the rate of unemployment to an astronomical high. Ruining career
          outlook for various jobs with a large range of education requirements. With advancements in Information
          processing for these models, tremendous concern has gathered around privacy breaching and civil liberty
          violations.
